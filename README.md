LAB 7 (Mar 31) ‚îÄ Unix Utilities and common shell functionalities

Part I Unix Utilities/commands

The purpose of this lab exercise is for you to get some hands-on experience on using some fundamental Unix utilities (commands). After this lab, you are expected to be able to accomplish lots tasks using command line utilities, without resorting to your GUI based utilities such as File Manager. Command line execution is faster than GUI based utilities in general. Also in some systems GUI tools are not available at all and thus using command line utilities is your only option. We covered in class the following basic utilities/commands: man, pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, rmdir, cat, more, head, tail, cp, mv, rm, wc, chmod, chgrp, grep/egrep. We also discussed how to use pipe to use one utility‚Äôs output as the input of another utility. In the next class we will also cover uniq, sort, cmp/diff, cut, find etc.

You can get the specifications of each utility by using utility man. E.g., man chmod or even better, man 1 chmod Go through the following 110 (small) practices. Write down your answers (with question #) besides the questions. Note: Each question should be solved with only one entry of utility (e.g., cp file1 file2) or a pipeline of utilities (e.g., cat file1 | sort | wc).

0. Login to your home directory, change to Bourne (again) shell by issuing sh or bash.The prompt should change from % to $. Now create a working directory for this lab, and navigate to the working directory.

1. There is a file named xxx in directory /eecs/dept/course/2018-19/W/2031Z/ Copy this file to your current working directory, using one entry of utility (command).

2. Check that the file is copied here.

$ ls xxx xxx

$

3. TherearetwofilesnamedxFile2andxFile3indirectory/eecs/dept/course/2018-19/W/2031Z/

Copy these two files to your current working directory using one entry of utility. Assume these two files are the only files whose names begin with ‚ÄòxFile‚Äô. Hint: so you can use xFile* or File? to match these two files. (If you don‚Äôt understand * and ?, look for page 10 of the Guided Lab Tour for CSE1020). Note, don‚Äôt confuse that with * and ? that are used in (extended) regular expression. .

4. Verify that the 2 files are copied successfully to the current directory.

$ ls xFile* xFile2 xFile3

$ ls

xxx xFile2 xFile3

<ol start="5">
<li>Rename file xxx to xFile1</li>
<li>Verify that the renaming is successful.One (professional) way to verify if an execution of a utility is successful is to examine the exit code (return value) of the executed process, which is stored in a system variable $?. Issue echo $? You should see 0, which means successful (this is opposite to C where 0 means false).
Also verify by listing files

$ your_command xFile1 xFile2 xFile3
</li>
<li>(1) Create a sub-directory named 2019 under your current working directory. (2)Then still in the current working directory, create a subdirectory lab7a under 2019.</li>

17. Then list the information of lab7a itself

$ your-command

drwx‚Äî‚Äî 2 yourname ugrad 48 Mar 25 15:12 lab7a

18. Copy directory lab7a to a new directory named lab7b (using one utility).

19. Verify that lab7b is created and the two directory are identical $ ls -l *

20. Remove the whole directory lab7a using rmdir. What happened?

21. Examine the exit code of the above execution, you should get 1, which means something wrong happened. 22. Remove the whole directory lab7a using a more effective utility.

23. (1) Verify the exit code of above execution, you should get 0 now

(2) Verify by trying to list lab7a

$ ls lab7a

ls: cannot access lab7a: No such file or directory

24. Move xFile1, which is in subdirectory lab7b, to current (parent) directory, using relative pathname.

25. Verify that the above move was successful. Instead of listing the files, let‚Äôs verify by searching for the files.

$ find . ‚Äìname ‚ÄúxFile*‚Äù or find . ‚Äìname ‚ÄúxFile?‚Äù ./lab7b/xFile2

<pre>   ./lab7b/xFile3

31. Display on stdout the contents of file xFile1

32. Display on stdout the contents of the three files with one entry (Try more xFile1 xFile2 xFile3 or more

xFile? Use space bar to proceed.)

33. Check how many lines xFile1 contains. You should get 5.

34. Display (only) the first two line of xFile1

35. Display the last 3 lines of xFile2

36. (1) Confirm that xFile1 and xFile2 are identical now, using a utility, which should return silently (Hint: cmp or

diff). (2) Then examine the exit code, you should get 0.

37. (1) Confirm that xFile1 and xFile2 are identical, using another utility, which should return silently (diff or

cmp). (2) Examine the exit code, you should get 0.

38. (1) Show that xFile2 and xFile3 are not identical, using diff utility, which will not be silent this time. Try to

understand the message but don‚Äôt spend too much time on it. (2) Examine the exit code, you should get 1. 39. (1) Show that xFile2 and xFile3 are not identical, using cmp utility, which will not be silent this time. Try to

understand the message but don‚Äôt spend too much time on it. (2) Examine the exit code, you should get 1.

40. (1) Concatenate the contents of the three files into a new file xFile123, in the order of xFile1,xFile2 and xFile3. Hint:usecatandredirection&gt;.

(2) After that, show on stdout the content of xFile123.

47. Change the permission of xFile123compact using octal numbers so that the permission becomes -rwxr‚Äìr‚Äì 1 yourname ugrad 140 Mar 25 17:23 xFile123compact

48. Change the permission of xFile123compact by giving group an execute permission. You should get the following result: -rwxr-xr‚Äì 1 yourname ugrad 145 Mar 25 17:23 xFile123compact

49. Change the permission of xFile123compact by giving group a write permission, and remove read permission of

the others of the file. You should issue chmod only once. You should get the following result:

-rwxrwx‚Äî 1 yourname ugrad 145 Mar 25 17:23 xFile123compact

50. Change the permission of xFile123compact by removing write permission from group, and giving write and

execute permission to others. You should issue chmod only once. You should get the following result: ‚Äìrwxr-x-wx 1 yourname ugrad 145 Mar 25 17:23 xFile123compact

51. Change the permission of xFile123 by adding the read permission to user, group and others (although they may already have one). You should issue chmod only once. You should get the following result:

<pre>    ‚Äìrw-r--r--  1 yourname ugrad 145 Mar 25 31 17:23 xFile123compact

52. Modify xFile1 by adding a new line at the end of the file. This can be done by

echo ‚Äúthis is a xxx new line‚Äù &gt;&gt; xFile1 or

cat &gt;&gt; xFile1 and then enter ‚Äúthis is a xxx new line‚Äù, followed by Ctrl-D.

Question 54-57 should be done without using sort. Utility ls can do sorting itself.

53. List the files in the current directory, sorted by the modification time. xFile1 should be the first file in the list

and other files are also sorted according to the modification time.

$ your_command

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

54. List the files, sorted by the modification time, in reverse order. xFile1 should become the last file in the list. 55. List the files, sorted by the size of the files. xFile123 should be the first file in the list and other files are also

sorted according to the sizes.

The following exercises involve searching matches in files. (Use egrep or grep ‚ÄìE , which guarantee to accept the extended regular expression) and make sure you are in sh or bash.

72. (1) Use grep or egrep to get the people who are logging on using yorku.ca network. (2) Then reverse the

result, showing who logon using non yorku.ca network (so you can see clearly who is logon from the department and who is logon from outside, e.g., from home. Occasionally I use this trick to check if the professors I want to drop by is currently in the office ‚Äì you‚Äôd better hold off going if he is currently logged on from non-York network such as bell or rogers üôÇ

73. Display records of people in file xFile123compact who has a field value 2 in the record. $ egrep 2 xFile123compact

76. Get the number of peoples in xFile123compact who were born in 1950s. You should get 2.

77. The EECS department maintains the records of all the students, staff and faculty members in a file /etc/passwd, one person per line. Issue a command to see the content of the file.

For such a long file, cat is not a good choice.

78. Issue a utility to find out how many people are in the list. You should get about 3656.

79. Find out the number of people with name Wang in the file /etc/passwd. You should get about 43.

The (modified) class list of our class can be found at /eecs/dept/course/2018-19/W/2031Z/classlist. Each line of the file contains one student information, where the first column is the EECS login id.

80. Get the number of students currently enrolled in the course. You should get 145. You can use the file directly

(by giving the pathname), or, copy the file to your current directory.

81. Retrieve your record from the class list.

82. Get the number of students whose family name is Wang. You should get 0

83. Get the number of students whose family name is Zhang. You should get 2.

84. Confirm 83 by retrieving the record of students whose family name is Zhang. You should see two lines.

85. Get the number of students whose family name is Leung. You should get 2.

86. Confirm 85 by retrieving the record of students whose family name is Leung. You should see two lines.

87. Get the number of students whose family name is Chen or Chan. You should get 2.

Hint, from the perspective of regular expression, Ch[ae]n or ‚ÄúChan | Chen‚Äù will do the trick.

88. Confirm 87 by retrieving the record of students whose family name is Chen or Chan. You should see two lines. 89. Look for the students whose eecs login id (in the first column of the file) starts with cse.

91. cut is a utility that can extract columns of a text file. By default cut assumes that the columns are separated by tab. (We can also specify other delimiters such as space or comma). To specify the columns to extract, use -f. Issue cut -f 1 classlist Observe that the only eecs user info (the first column) is displayed.

Issue cut -f 4 classlist Observe that the only names (the 4th column) is displayed.

Issue cut -f 1-3 classlist Observe that columns 1 to 3 are displayed.

Issue cut -f 1,4 classlist Observe that the first and the 4th column are displayed.

Part II Common shell functionalities and corresponding meta-characters

In the last lecture we discussed some functionalities that are common among the different shells, and their associated meta-characters. In part I above we have experienced some of them, for example, Pipes |, Filename substitution (wildcards) * ? [], Redirections &lt; &gt; &gt;&gt;. Here you will practice some more functionalities, including Command substitution ` `, Variable substitution $, Conditional sequence &amp;&amp; ||, and Quotes ‚Äù and ‚Äù ‚Äú.

<li>Issue a single command to output There are 2 students in EECS2031Z with family name Zhang where 2 comes from the result of a command that reads from file classlist.</li>
<li>Issue a single command to output There are 3 students in EECS2031Z whose eecs username begins with cse where 3 comes from the result of a command that reads from file classlist.113. Conditional sequence &amp;&amp; ||. 1) For a series of commands separated by ‚Äú&amp;&amp;‚Äù tokens, the next command is executed only if the previous command returns an exit code of 0. Which means ‚Äòsuccessful‚Äô. 2) For a series of commands separated by ‚Äú||‚Äù tokens, the next command is executed only if the previous command returns a non-zero exit code, which means ‚Äòunsuccessful‚Äô.</li>

114. There are often times when you want to inhibit the shell‚Äôs filename-substitution (wild-card) * ? [], variable- substitution $, and/or command-substitution ` ` mechanisms. The shell‚Äôs quoting system allows you to do just that. The way that it works is: 1) Single quotes (‚Äò ‚Äò) inhibits both wildcard substitution, variable substitution, and command substitution. 2) Double quotes(‚Äù ‚Äú) inhibits wildcard substitution only.

<ul>
<li>Issue courseN=2031Z; (no space around =) This assign variable courseN with value 2031Z

Then issue echo 3 * 4 = 12, course name is $courseN ‚Äì today‚Äôs date is `date`

Observe that both filename-substitution (wildcard) *, variable-substitution $n, and command-substitution `date` are interpreted. Among them the wildcard-substitution is interpreted as ‚Äòany file name‚Äô.</li>
<li>Then issue echo ‚Äò 3 * 4 = 12, course name is $courseN ‚Äì today‚Äôs date is `date` ‚Äò Observe that interpretation of filename-substitution (wildcard) * is inhibited. Interpretation of variable- substitution $n and command substitution `date` are also inhibited, due to the fact that single quote ‚Äò ‚Äò inhibited the interpretation of both the three substitutions.</li>
<li>Finally, issue echo ‚Äù 3 * 4 = 12, course name is $courseN ‚Äì today‚Äôs date is `date` ‚Äù Observe that interpretation of * is inhibited. Interpretation of variable-substitution $n and `date` are not inhibited, due to the fact that double quote ‚Äù ‚Äù inhibits the interpretation of filename-substitution (wild- card) * only.</li>
